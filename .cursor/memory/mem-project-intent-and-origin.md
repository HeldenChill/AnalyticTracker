# Memory: AnalyticTracker — intent, decision history, current status

**ID:** `mem-project-intent-and-origin`
**Parent:** `mem-project-index`
**Last updated:** 2026-10-07
**Related:** `mem-system-architecture` (what exists now), `mem-lessons-firebase-bigquery-data`, `mem-lessons-windows-flutter-environment`, `mem-lessons-gemini-plan-review-workflow`, `mem-known-bugs-index`

## Intent (owner-stated)

- **Standalone app**, separate from any game. Targets: **Windows first**, then Android / iOS / Web.
- **Users:** small team (designer, PM, dev) reading shared dashboards — not a power-user query tool (query builder deferred).
- **Job:** pull game analytics from Firebase (via BigQuery export) **daily**, keep own copy, show **GameAnalytics-style** analysis.
- First data source: PetVsMonster (PVM). Repo: `D:\Projects\AnalyticTracker`, branch `feature/flutter-local-server`.

## Roles in this project

| Who | Does |
|---|---|
| Owner | Decides every design fork; runs Gemini; performs IAM/OS/installer steps |
| Claude | Research, brainstorming, specs, step-by-step plans, code review, runtime verification, small fixes on request |
| Gemini 3.8 | Implements the plans task-by-task (v1–v4), commits per task |

## Decision timeline (2026-10-06 unless dated)

| Round | Owner decision | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Stack research | Compare every stack before choosing → `docs/research/stack-comparison.md` (Flutter vs PWA tied 26) | — |
| Debate 2 | iOS web link enough; new language OK; **BigQuery stays sandbox**; app independent of Firebase | own data copy |
| Debate 3 | **Local server first**, simple save/load; Flutter client; **Dart server** (over Python) | spec `.cursor/plans/flutter-local-server-stack.md` |
| Data | **Raw events kept forever** in own SQLite (outlives 60-day sandbox expiry) | — |
| Platform | **Windows build first**, other platforms after Windows settles | — |
| v1 | Implemented by Gemini (plan `flutter-local-server-implementation.md`), reviewed by Claude | BUG-0001..0004 |
| Data access | SA key lacks BigQuery roles, owner cannot grant IAM now → **manual BigQuery console export + `bin/import.dart`** | 5,002 real events imported |
| v2 | "Do like GameAnalytics": dashboards first (designer/PM), Overview + Retention + Progression, sidebar, global filters (date + platform + version), server-side SQL per page; Progression reads **`stg_*` only**; retention cohort = **`first_open`** | spec `gameanalytics-dashboard-design.md`, plan `gameanalytics-dashboard-implementation.md` |
| v3 | Funnels like GameAnalytics: **strict order + time window**, **saved on server, shared**, **one param filter per step**; styles: owner asked for a **live web demo**, then chose **all four** with a Settings switch | spec `funnels-and-styles-design.md`, plan `funnels-and-styles-implementation.md`, demo https://claude.ai/artifact/Y3Qpmvo8jHbpuupEfWioDS |
| v3.1 (10-07) | "Apply fix for all bug except IAM" → Claude's recommendations applied inline: exclude test devices by default + toggle; up to 5 ANDed param filters per funnel step | BUG-0005..0009 VERIFY_PENDING |
| v4 (10-07) | MCP so Claude can use the app: analysis + manage funnels + data ops; owner now, team later; Dart stdio MCP over HTTP API | spec `mcp-server-design.md`, plan `mcp-server-implementation.md`, Gemini implemented, Claude reviewed OK |

## Status (end of 2026-10-07 session) — START HERE

- Branch `feature/flutter-local-server`, v1–v4 committed, nothing pushed (owner pushes). **v5 funnel upgrade: spec + wave 1 plan committed, waiting for Gemini to implement wave 1.**
- Gates (before wave 1): shared **34**, server **140**, app **65**; after wave 1 the plan expects **42 / 158 / 75**.
- v5 = `funnel-upgrade-design.md` (4 waves: 1 richer matching + point-and-click editor, 2 compare segments, 3 trend, 4 who dropped + timeline + CSV). Wave 1 plan `funnel-wave1-implementation.md` (Tasks 0–7); code pre-verified task by task in a throwaway worktree. Next: owner runs Gemini → Claude reviews (playbook checklist) → wave 2 plan.
- API server on :8080 was restarted by Claude with v4 code (has `POST /import`). If a new session finds 404 on `/import`, it is a stale server.
- Saved funnel id 1 "Level 1-2 progression" (first_open → level_1_start → level_1_complete → level_2_start → level_2_complete): last 30 days, test devices off = 75 → 22 → 7 → 4 → 3, 4% total. (2026-10-06 figure 79 included test devices.)
- Owner-side pending: (1) approve `analytic-tracker` project MCP in Claude Code → then Claude can call the 14 tools directly; (2) visual check of BUG-0005..0009 in the Windows app (build release, screenshots of all 4 styles: tooltip contrast/ints, KPI row of six at 1440 px, "Test devices" chip, two-filter funnel step) → move to RESOLVED.

## Next-step candidates (owner picks)

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| Review v5 wave 1 after Gemini | Then write wave 2 (segments) plan from the same spec |
| Verify BUG-0005..0009 in app | Release build + screenshots; recipe in `mem-lessons-windows-flutter-environment` |
| API token (BUG-0010) | Prerequisite before teammates use MCP/API; own spec |
| `pull_now` MCP tool | Only after IAM fixed |
| Other platforms (Android/iOS/Web) | Owner said after Windows settles |

## History 2026-10-06

- v1 + v2 + v3 implemented by Gemini (32 commits). Windows release build verified at runtime with screenshots of all four styles and the Funnels page. Review found BUG-0005..0009.

## 2026-10-07

- Owner: "apply fix for all bug, except IAM" → Claude applied its recommendations for BUG-0005..0009 directly (no Gemini plan): test devices excluded by default + "Test devices" chip; 2+ ANDed param filters per funnel step (spec §3 amended). All VERIFY_PENDING until seen in the Windows app.
- v4 MCP (brainstorm → spec → plan, same day): owner chose **analysis + manage funnels + data ops**, **owner now / team later**, approach **A = Dart stdio MCP (`dart_mcp`) calling the HTTP API** (not direct SQLite, not `/mcp` in shelf). No `pull_now` until IAM; no raw SQL; API token required before team use. Spec `mcp-server-design.md`, plan `mcp-server-implementation.md` (5 tasks, for Gemini).
- v4 implemented by Gemini (commits b4f2f59..b7889b3), reviewed by Claude: all 7 new files byte-identical to plan; gates shared 34 / server 140 / app 65; runtime via `cmd /c dart run server/bin/mcp.dart` against live server OK (overview == API, funnel 1 = 75 → 3, 4%; import dry run 57 days all match; save/delete; server-down hint). Pending owner: approve `analytic-tracker` in Claude Code (`claude mcp list`). Risk BUG-0010 (no API auth) deferred.

- v5 funnel upgrade (brainstorm → spec → plan, same day): owner chose **all four** gaps (richer matching, segments, trend, who dropped) in **waves**; matching = operators + or-events + exclusions + any order; breakdown by platform / version / step-1 param / user property; drill-down = player list + in-app timeline + CSV; architecture **A = paths core** (walk once → `PlayerPath`, aggregators on top, matching in Dart). Owner asked for a **point-and-click editor, no typed syntax** (spec §3.4). Data reality: platform only ANDROID, user props only Firebase automatic keys.

## Open owner decisions

| Item | Question | Assistant recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| IAM | Grant a read-only SA (BigQuery Data Viewer + Job User) to enable the automatic daily pull | Dedicated `analytic-tracker-pull` SA, not the Admin SDK key |

## Workspace setup history

- Copied from PVM (PVM untouched): 12 generic rules, `/debug-bug`, `/find-bug`, skills caveman+cavecrew, keyword-matching memory hook, 19 user auto-memory files. Unity/MCP/asmdef/AutoTest rules, layer agents, PVM memories NOT copied.
- Plugins caveman, superpowers, ponytail are enabled globally (`~/.claude/settings.json` `enabledPlugins`).
- Memory hook keyword-matches the prompt against `mem-project-index.md` `## Memory index` (max 15 rows) — full-table injection overflowed the ~10 KB hook cap in PVM.
- Gemini adds its own `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.agents/` (owner's files; leave untracked unless owner commits).
